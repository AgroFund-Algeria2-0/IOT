Key IoT problems in your ecosystem include:
   1. Equipment monitoring and ROI tracking for investors
   2. Crop health and growth monitoring for transparency
   3. Environmental monitoring for risk assessment
   4. Automated irrigation and resource management
   5. Supply chain traceability from farm to market
   6. Fraud prevention and verification of farming activities

For your platform's needs, I propose a simple IoT solution focused on equipment monitoring and basic environmental
  sensors that can provide transparency to investors while keeping costs low.

   The Circuit Components:
   1. ESP32 Microcontroller: The "brain" that collects data from sensors and sends it to the cloud
   2. Temperature/Humidity Sensor (DHT22): Measures environmental conditions
   3. Soil Moisture Sensor: Measures water content in soil
   4. Light Sensor: Monitors sunlight/illumination levels
   5. LED: Visual indicator for equipment status (working/idle)
   6. GPS Module (simulated): Tracks equipment location

  What's Displayed on the Dashboard:
   1. Temperature Readings: Shows current farm environmental conditions
   2. Soil Moisture Levels: Shows how wet/dry the soil is
   3. Light Intensity: Shows current illumination levels
   4. Equipment Status: Shows if farming equipment is currently operational
   5. Equipment Location: Shows where the equipment is currently located
   6. Alerts: Notifications when conditions need attention

  How It Helps the Farmer:
   1. Real-time Monitoring: Knows exactly what's happening in their fields without being physically present
   2. Optimal Timing: Knows when to water crops based on actual soil moisture readings
   3. Equipment Management: Can verify that equipment is working as expected
   4. Resource Efficiency: Optimizes water usage based on real data
   5. Remote Management: Can monitor multiple farms from one location

  How It Helps the Investor:
   1. Transparency: Can see that their equipment investment is actually being used
   2. ROI Verification: Confirms that farming activities are happening as promised
   3. Risk Management: Gets early warnings if conditions aren't suitable for crops
   4. Trust Building: Provides objective proof of farming activities
   5. Data-Driven Decisions: Can evaluate the success of their investment with real data
